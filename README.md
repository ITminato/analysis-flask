The error message you received suggests that there is an issue with the "create_app" module and its dependencies. Specifically, it seems to be encountering an "undefined symbol" error related to the "_Py_CheckRecursionLimit" symbol.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Confirm that all required dependencies are installed: Ensure that you have installed all the necessary packages and libraries required by the "create_app" module and its dependencies. Make sure you have installed the correct versions of Python and any other required dependencies.

Check the "create_app.so" module: Verify that the "create_app.so" module is present in the specified location "/var/www/analysis-flask/create_app.so". If the module is missing, you may need to reinstall or recompile it.

Recompile the module: If the "create_app.so" module is already present, it's possible that it was compiled with incompatible options or against a different version of Python. Try recompiling the module using the correct options and ensuring that it is compatible with the Python version you are using.

Review the code: Check the code in the "create_app.py" module and ensure that there are no syntax errors or missing imports. Make sure that the module has been imported correctly in the "app_analysis2.py" file.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "undefined symbol" error and successfully run your application.
